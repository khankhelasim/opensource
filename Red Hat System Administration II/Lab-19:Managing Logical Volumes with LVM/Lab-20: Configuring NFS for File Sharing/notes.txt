Lab 20: Configuring NFS for File Sharing

✔ NFS (Network File System) allows file sharing between Linux systems.
✔ We configured one as the Server and the other as the Client.
✔ Server exports a shared directory using /etc/exports.
✔ Client mounts it manually and permanently via /etc/fstab.
✔ Verified file synchronization between server and client.
✔ Adjusted permissions, firewall, and service status for stable access.
