Lab 16 Summary: Adjusting CPU Scheduling with nice and renice

Concepts Covered:
- Linux uses a priority-based CPU scheduling system.
- Each process has a “nice value” ranging from -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest).
- Default nice value is 0.

Commands Used:
- nice → set priority when starting a process.
- renice → change priority of an already running process.
- ps -l → view process priority in NI column.
- htop → visualize CPU usage and process priorities.

Key Learnings:
- Higher priority (negative nice) gets more CPU time.
- Lower priority (positive nice) yields CPU to others.
- Priority management helps improve system responsiveness and control resource usage.
