Lab 17 Summary: Configuring I/O Scheduler

Concepts Covered:
- The I/O scheduler controls how Linux manages read/write requests to storage devices.
- Different schedulers are suited to different workloads (server, desktop, SSD, etc.).

Key Commands:
- ls /sys/block/sd*/queue/scheduler → view available schedulers
- echo 'mq-deadline' | sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler → temporary change
- /etc/udev/rules.d/60-io-schedulers.rules → persistent configuration
- iostat -x 2 → monitor I/O stats
- dd and fio → performance testing tools

Observations:
- mq-deadline performs well on servers with predictable workloads.
- bfq is smoother for desktops or interactive systems.
- kyber is optimized for SSD/NVMe performance.
- none removes scheduling overhead, good for virtual disks or RAID arrays.

Conclusion:
You learned to:
- Inspect and change the I/O scheduler.
- Persist configuration using udev.
- Benchmark disk performance under different schedulers.
