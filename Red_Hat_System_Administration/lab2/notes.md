# Notes for Lab 2

- Learned the difference between local login and remote SSH login.
- Faced issue with SSH until verifying firewall and service status.
- Useful troubleshooting:
  - `ping <ip>` to check connectivity.
  - `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all` for firewall rules.
- Practiced `pwd`, `ls`, and `man` which are essential for daily Linux use.
- Customizing PS1 helped make the prompt more informative (added current time).
- For permanent customization, `.bashrc` must be updated.
