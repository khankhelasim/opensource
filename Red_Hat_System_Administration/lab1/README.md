# Lab 1: Introduction to Red Hat Enterprise Linux

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, I achieved the following:
- Understood the fundamentals of open-source software.
- Learned about Linux distributions and their significance.
- Explored Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) characteristics and its subscription model.

## Prerequisites
- A system with internet access.
- A terminal or CLI.
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Understanding Open Source and Linux
- Fetched the **Open Source Definition** from the OSI website using `curl`.
- Checked the **Linux kernel version** with `uname -r`.

### Task 2: Exploring Linux Distributions
- Identified major Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL).
- Verified the current distribution using `cat /etc/os-release`.

### Task 3: RHEL Characteristics and Subscription
- Checked the **SELinux status** with `sestatus`.
- Explored the **RHEL subscription model** using `subscription-manager`.

## Key Learnings
- Open-source software allows free redistribution, source code access, and modifications.
- RHEL is enterprise-focused with long-term support and strong security via SELinux.
- The subscription model provides access to updates, support, and certified software.

## Next Steps
- Continue practicing RHEL commands on a live system.
- Explore the Red Hat Developer Program for free resources.
