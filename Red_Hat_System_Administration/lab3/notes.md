# Notes for Lab 3

- Learned how to create, copy, move, and delete files/directories entirely via CLI.
- Metadata from `ls -l` and `stat` provides essential details like permissions and inode numbers.
- Practiced redirecting and appending output into files with `>` and `>>`.
- Realized that `rm -r` is powerful but dangerous â€” it permanently deletes files without recovery.
- Pro tip: Use `cp -i`, `mv -i`, and `rm -i` for safer operations.
- These skills are foundational for Linux administration and scripting.
