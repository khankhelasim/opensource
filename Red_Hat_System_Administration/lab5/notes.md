# Lab 5 Notes

- **vim** is powerful but requires practice (insert mode, normal mode, commands).
- **nano** is simpler, beginner-friendly, shows key shortcuts at the bottom.
- **sed** is best for inline replacements and pattern deletions in files.
- **awk** is useful for working with structured text (CSV, logs, reports).
- Combine `sed` and `awk` in scripts for automation (e.g., log analysis).
