# Notes for Lab 4

- `man` pages are structured into sections (1 â€“ commands, 5 â€“ config files, etc.).
- Navigation tips: `Space` (down), `b` (up), `/search`, `q` (quit).
- `info` is more structured for GNU utilities (e.g., coreutils).
- `--help` is a quick way to recall syntax without opening long manuals.
- `/usr/share/doc` holds documentation per package; often contains examples or README files.
- `whatis` = one-line summary of a command.
- `apropos` = search for commands by functionality/keywords.
- `dnf info <pkg>` and `dnf changelog <pkg>` give metadata and update history.
- Combining these methods ensures I can always troubleshoot locally without internet.
