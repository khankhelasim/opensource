Lab 18: SELinux Basics

Key Learnings:
- SELinux context has 4 parts: user:role:type:level
- Type is the most important field for access control
- Apache (httpd) can only read files labeled with httpd_sys_content_t
- chcon changes context temporarily
- restorecon restores defaults from policy
- semanage fcontext makes permanent changes
- AVC denials are logged in /var/log/audit/audit.log
- ausearch and sealert help analyze denials

Common Issues:
- If service httpd not found → install httpd (Fedora/RHEL) or apache2 (Ubuntu)
- If sealert not working → start setroubleshootd
- Connection refused errors → ensure httpd/apache2 is installed and running
