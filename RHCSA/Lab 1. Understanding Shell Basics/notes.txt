# Notes: Lab 1 – Understanding Shell Basics

- The shell interprets commands typed by the user.
- Every command follows the pattern:

command [options] [arguments]

- `>` overwrites output to a file.
- `>>` appends output to a file.
- `<` uses file content as command input.
- Hidden files start with a `.` (dot).
- `~` represents the home directory.
- `..` moves one directory up.
- Always use `pwd` to verify your current location in the filesystem.
